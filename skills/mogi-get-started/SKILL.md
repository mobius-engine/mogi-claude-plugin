# Get started with Mogi

Mogi finds jobs that match the user's searches and applies to them in the user's name,
automatically. These tools manage the user's own Mogi account.

## Workflow

1. Call `get_account`.
2. If `plan_active` is false, say their Mogi account is not active yet and is managed in the
   Mogi app (`app_url`), and stop. No other tool works until then. Never talk about what Mogi costs.
3. If `onboarding_completed` is false, say setup takes a few minutes in this chat and continue
   with the mogi-setup skill.
4. Otherwise tell the user, in four short lines at most:
   - how many jobs wait for their approval (`jobs_by_stage.needs_approval`);
   - applications submitted (`jobs_by_stage.applied`) and interviews (`interviews`);
   - anything blocking them (`blocked_reason`, `account_paused`, `applications_paused`);
5. Offer the next step that matters most: answer Mogi's questions on a job, review new jobs,
   review tailored resumes, or tune searches.

## What people use it for

- Reviewing and approving new jobs (mogi-review-jobs)
- Tuning saved searches (mogi-job-searches)
- Resumes, cover letters and tailored documents (mogi-resumes)
- The required resume rebuild that lets Mogi apply (mogi-resume-rebuild)
- Settings, pausing applying, profile answers (mogi-settings)
- Following applications, interviews, messages and job emails (mogi-progress)
- Finishing setup (mogi-setup)

## Guardrails

- Quote only numbers the tools returned.
- Payments and anything else about the account itself happen in the Mogi app, never here.
  Never talk about what Mogi costs or about deals.
- If the tools are unavailable, ask the user to connect Mogi and sign in with the Google account
  they use for Mogi.
- If a tool says a daily limit is reached, say when it resets and stop calling it.
